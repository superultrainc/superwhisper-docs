## Projects
  <Card title="Macrowhisper" href="https://github.com/ognistik/macrowhisper">
    Macrowhisper watches your Superwhisper recordings folder and reacts in real time—automatically running smart actions when your dictations are processed. You can set up rules to have it insert text, open links, trigger shell scripts, run AppleScripts, or even trigger MacOS Shortcuts. It runs quietly in the background, and you can tweak everything on the fly using a simple JSON config.
