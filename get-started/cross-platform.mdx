## Device Limits

- **Mac:** Unlimited computers
- **Windows:** Unlimited computers
- **iPhone:** Your personal device
- **iPad:** Your personal device

You can activate on as many Mac and Windows computers as you own. Your license is tied to your email, not a specific device.

---

## Data Sync Between Devices

<Warning>
Custom modes, vocabulary, and settings do not currently sync between devices. Each device has its own independent configuration.
</Warning>

This means:
- Custom modes created on Mac won't appear on iPhone
- Vocabulary additions are device-specific
- Settings need to be configured separately on each device

Cloud sync for settings is planned for a future update.
