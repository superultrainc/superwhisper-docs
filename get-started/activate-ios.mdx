  <Step title="License Activation">
    To complete activation, you'll need to scan a QR code from your desktop app:
      1. In the desktop app, open the Settings panel. At the bottom left, click the button labeled “Superwhisper” to view your license details.
      2. Locate the mobile activation QR code
      3. Use your iOS device to scan the displayed code

## Troubleshooting

**Having trouble with the QR code? Here's a simple fix:**

    1. Open the QR code screen on your Mac
    2. Double-click your license key (you'll see "Copied to clipboard")
    3. Create the activation link:
        - Start with: `superwhisper://license/`
        - Paste your key after the slash
        - Example: `superwhisper://license/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`
    4. Open this link on your iOS device

    This manual activation method works just as well as the QR code scan.
