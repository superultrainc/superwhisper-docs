## Troubleshooting

**Having trouble with the QR code? Here's a simple fix:**

    1. Open the QR code screen on your Mac
    2. Double-click your license key (you'll see "Copied to clipboard")
    3. Create the activation link:
        - Start with: `superwhisper://license/`
        - Paste your key after the slash
        - Example: `superwhisper://license/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`
    4. Open this link on your iOS device

    This manual activation method works just as well as the QR code scan.
