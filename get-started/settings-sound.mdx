## Input Device
Your dictation quality depends on having the right audio settings. Superwhisper's sound configuration lets you pick your microphone, set optimal volume levels, and customize how it works on your particular audio setup.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Input Device">
    Choose your preferred audio input or let Superwhisper automatically select based on system defaults. The automatic option ensures Superwhisper always uses your system's primary input device.
  <Note>You can also change your input device directly from the Superwhisper [menu bar icon](interface-menu-bar). This gives you easy access to this setting without opening the full settings panel.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Microphone Volume">
    Enable automatic volume adjustment (recommended) to set your microphone's input level for clear voice recordings. This ensures your voice is captured at the right volume without manual adjustments.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Want faster processing and better results with your transcription? Check out the [silence removal](settings-advanced#voice-processing-options) setting in Advanced Configuration.

## Sound Effects
**Superwhisper includes customizable audio feedback to enhance your dictation experience.** These subtle cues help you stay informed about the application's status without needing to watch the screen. You can adjust the volume of sound effects independently from your system volume, or disable them completely if you prefer silent operation.
