<Note>
While many core capabilities are already available on the Windows platform, some features are still in active development.
</Note>

## Features Not Yet Supported

We're currently working on bringing the following features to parity with our macOS application:

### FileSync
[FileSync](settings-advanced#filesync) allows your Superwhisper configuration files to automatically sync across all installations registered under the same license. This feature is in active development for Windows.

### Speaker Separation
Speaker separation (also known as diarization) is currently a work in progress on Windows. While some models may support limited diarization capabilities, full support with all voice models is not yet available.

### Record from System Audio
The ability to [record from system audio](../modes/modes#advanced-settings) is available on Windows, but it's currently behind an experimental feature toggle for our enhanced audio engine.

<Info>
Experimental features may be unstable or have limited functionality. By trying them out, you can help us improve Superwhisper for Windows and move toward a stable feature release.

### Parakeet Local Voice Model
The [Parakeet Multilanguage](../models/voice#nvidia-parakeet-local) model is available on Windows and is currently behind the "experimental models" feature toggle.

### Local Language Models
Local language models that run entirely on your device are not yet supported on Windows. You can still use cloud-based language models for AI processing.

### Mouse Button Shortcuts
[Mouse button shortcuts](settings-shortcuts#mouse-shortcut) that allow you to control recording with mouse buttons are not yet available on Windows. Keyboard shortcuts remain fully functional.

### Automatically Increase Microphone Volume
Automatic microphone volume adjustment is not yet implemented on Windows. You may need to manually adjust your microphone settings through Windows system preferences.

### Restore Clipboard After Paste
The [Restore Clipboard](settings-advanced#restore-clipboard) setting that automatically restores your previous clipboard content after pasting dictation results is not yet supported on Windows.

### Single Modifier Key Activation
We're actively working on implementing this feature, but at the moment [Single modifier key activation](settings-shortcuts#toggle-recording) is not yet available on Windows. You'll need to use modifier key combinations instead.
