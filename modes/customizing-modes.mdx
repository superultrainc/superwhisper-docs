<Note>This guide covers a more advanced workflow that requires basic understanding of AI prompting and Superwhisper's features. If you're new to Superwhisper, start with the built-in modes first.</Note>

## Overview
Built-in modes are regularly updated based on user feedback to cover common use cases. **To customize a built-in mode, you will essentially need to copy its AI instructions to create a new [Custom Mode](custom) with this.** While your customized version won't receive AI instruction updates when enhancements are published for the original mode, it's still a great way to create something tailored to your needs without starting from scratch.

## Step-by-Step
