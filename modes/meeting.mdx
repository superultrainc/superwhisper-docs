## Key Features
**Meeting Mode helps you get the most out of your meetings by:**
- Converting spoken discussions into structured summaries
- Highlighting key decisions and action items
- Preserving important context while removing redundant content

<Check>Ideal for team meetings, client calls, and any conversation you need to review or follow up on.</Check>

## Speaker Separation
By default, Meeting Mode does not separate speakers in the transcript. You can enable speaker separation in the [Advanced Settings sidebar](modes#advanced-settings). Please note that speaker labels will be visible in the [segments view only](../get-started/interface-history#speaker-separation) and are not included in AI-generated summaries or action items.
