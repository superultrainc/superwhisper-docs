## Choosing the Right Model
Since Voice Mode does not include AI processing, it is essential that you carefully choose the voice model according to your expected use case. Some suggestions are listed below, or feel free to explore from all the options available.

**Here's where to start based on your priorities - quick dictation, long recordings, speed, or privacy:**

    - **Parakeet (Local)**: Lightning-fast for short dictations (in English only).
    - **Ultra (Cloud)**: Fast, versatile, and accurate.
    - **Ultra Turbo v3 (Local)**: Great balance of speed and quality, with complete privacy.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Longer Recordings" icon="stars" horizontal>
    - **Nova (Cloud)**: Recommended for longer recordings and best for handling speaker separation.
