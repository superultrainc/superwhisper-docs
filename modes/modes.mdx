<Tip>For greater workflow flexibility, create different versions of each mode by customizing voice models, AI models, and other settings. **Click any mode's name to rename it.**</Tip>

## Per-Mode Settings

### Voice Processing
After dictating, your audio first goes through voice processing for transcription.
<Steps>

<Step title="Set your Language">
- Supported languages vary by voice model
- Based on your chosen language and voice model, you may see an option to translate your dictation to English. For best results with this option, use Pro, Standard, or Ultra models

<Note>Your preferred voice model does not support translation to English, or you need translation to another language? Set this up with AI processing by creating a [Custom mode](custom)</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Pick your Voice Model (Cloud or Local)">
Manage all your models in the Advanced Settings sidebar where you can:
- Download voice models for local use
- Connect your own API tokens for supported services
- Select from the available cloud-based models

<Note>Keep in mind: Once a mode activates for an app or site, you won't be able to override it, and the system doesn't automatically switch back to your previous mode.</Note>

### Advanced Settings
Belo the Auto-Activation Rules, you can select how your audio is handled during dictation.

* **Mute Audio While Recording**
* **Pause Media While Recording**
* **Record from System Audio**
  - Perfect for meetings, video content, interviews, or live audio coming your speakers
  - When recording system audio, the waves on the recording window do not move. You can always check Superwhisper's history to verify capture
* **Identify Speakers**
  - Useful for meeting transcriptions
  - Speaker separation results appear in the Segments tab of History

<Note>Speaker-separated transcripts won't process through AI automatically within the same mode. See [this guide](speaker-separated-meetings) on handling multi-speaker transcripts with AI processing.</Note>

### AI Processing
After transcription, AI processing shapes your text based on the mode's purpose.
