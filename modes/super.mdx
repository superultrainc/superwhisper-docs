## Key Features
**Super Mode enhances your dictation by:**
- Adapting messages to match application context
- Correcting spelling based on app-specific terms, names, and vocabulary
- Converting spoken URLs and emails into proper format
- Preserving message tone and intent while improving clarity

---
## Context Awareness
**Super Mode uses accessibility APIs to gather three types of context:**
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. Application Context">
     - Identifies your active application
     - Reads text from current input fields or text editor
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="2. Selected Text Context">
     - Reads any text you've highlighted
     - Uses selection to inform AI processing
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="3. Clipboard Context">
     - Incorporates text copied within 3 seconds of dictation, or during dictation
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---
## Commands
**Super Mode lets you dictate commands on selected text.** While it understands context, for best result use commands focused on text transformation or formatting rather than content analysis or generation.

<CardGroup>
   <Card title="Correct" icon="circle-check">
   "Make this text title case"
   "Convert selection to uppercase"
   "Format my selected text as bullet points"
   </Card>
   <Card title="Incorrect" icon="circle-xmark">
   "Summarize this paragraph"
   "Expand on these ideas"
   "Rewrite this section"
   </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>**While you can use commands for formatting, they're completely optional.** Just dictate naturally and Super Mode will intelligently adapt to your active app - no text selection or copying needed. It's that simple.</Tip>

## Troubleshooting
If you're not getting expected results with Super Mode, check these common issues:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Command Type Mismatch">
- If you are dictating a command, ensure it is related to formatting or text transformation only
- Review the Commands section above for examples
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AI Models">
Since Super Mode handles multiple types of context and more complex instructions, it may require advanced language understanding, such as that provided by Claude or GPT models. Using less capable or local models can lead to unexpected results, especially for tasks involving nuanced formatting or contextual adaptation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="System Settings & User Error">
- Check system settings for the correct permissions
- For application context, make sure the correct app window is active
- For selected text context, verify that the text is selected when triggering the dictation
- Text copied to your clipboard will only be processed if done within 3 seconds of starting your dictation or while you're speaking
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Verify Processing">
Check the History tab to see if context was properly sent to AI. You can view all AI-sent data in the bottom "prompt" field of the right sidebar. This can help you pinpoint if issues come from context capture, voice, or AI processing.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
