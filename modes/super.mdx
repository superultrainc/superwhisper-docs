## Key Features
**Super Mode enhances your dictation by:**
- Adapting messages to match application context
- Correcting spelling based on app-specific terms, names, and vocabulary
- Converting spoken URLs and emails into proper format
- Preserving message tone and intent while improving clarity

---
## Context Awareness
**Super Mode uses accessibility APIs to gather three types of context:**
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. Application Context">
     - Identifies your active application
     - Reads text from current input fields or text editor
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="2. Selected Text Context">
     - Reads any text you've highlighted
     - Uses selection to inform AI processing
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="3. Clipboard Context">
     - Incorporates text copied within 3 seconds of dictation, or during dictation
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---
## Commands
**Super Mode lets you dictate commands on selected text.** While it understands context, for best result use commands focused on text transformation or formatting rather than content analysis or generation.

<CardGroup>
   <Card title="Correct" icon="circle-check">
   "Make this text title case"
   "Convert selection to uppercase"
   "Format my selected text as bullet points"
   </Card>
   <Card title="Incorrect" icon="circle-xmark">
   "Summarize this paragraph"
   "Expand on these ideas"
   "Rewrite this section"
   </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>**While you can use commands for formatting, they're completely optional.** Just dictate naturally and Super Mode will intelligently adapt to your active app - no text selection or copying needed. It's that simple.</Tip>

## Troubleshooting
If you're not getting expected results with Super Mode, check these common issues:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Command Type Mismatch">
- If you are dictating a command, ensure it is related to formatting or text transformation only
- Review the Commands section above for examples
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="AI Models">
For optimal results, use one of the following suggested AI models:
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet
  - GPT-4o Mini
  - GPT-4o
  - Claude 3.5 Haiku
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="System Settings & User Error">
- Check system settings for the correct permissions
- For application context, make sure the correct app window is active
- For selected text context, verify that the text is selected when triggering the dictation
- Text copied to your clipboard will only be processed if done within 3 seconds of starting your dictation or while you're speaking
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Verify Processing">
Check the History tab to see if context was properly sent to AI. You can view all AI-sent data in the bottom "prompt" field of the right sidebar. This can help you pinpoint if issues come from context capture, voice, or AI processing.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
