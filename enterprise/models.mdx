## Custom Models

### Overview

Custom models allow you to configure specific AI models from various providers that your organization members can use.

### Adding a Custom Model

To add a custom model:

1. Navigate to the **Models** tab in your dashboard
2. Click the **+ Custom Model** button at the top right
3. Select your provider from the dropdown list, or Custom if your provider is not listed
4. Input your API Key for your provider, if applicable we will attempt to fetch models you have access to in your instance

<Info>Your API Key is encrypted at rest for security</Info>

5. Input other model details, and save
   - **Name** - A friendly name for the model (e.g., "GPT-5 Pro", "Anthropic Testing")
   - **Model ID** - The provider's model identifier (e.g., `gpt-5-mini`, `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
   - **API URL** - The endpoint URL for the model API

Each selected provider will have reference documentation linked at the bottom of custom model create

Once configured, your custom models will appear in the Custom Models table and can be modified / deleted

### Custom Model Distribution

When these settings are configured, your members will be given access to any models you've set up every time they start the app. These models can be selected by your members when they configure their modes, giving them the flexibility to choose the right AI model for their specific use case.

## Use Cases

### Cloud Models Only
Enable "Allow Cloud AI Models" and don't configure any custom models. This is the default setup - members use Superwhisper's hosted models with no additional configuration.

### Custom Models Only
Disable "Allow Cloud AI Models" and configure one or more custom models. This ensures all AI processing goes through your organization's approved providers with your own API credentials.

### Hybrid Approach
Enable "Allow Cloud AI Models" and configure custom models. Members can choose between Superwhisper's hosted models and your organization's custom models based on their needs.
