**Important:** Billing information is required in order to provision licenses to members.

### Seat-Based Pricing

Superwhisper functions on a seat-based pricing model:

- You can select either **monthly** or **yearly** billing when creating your subscription
- You will be charged for the number of seats purchased
- You can always purchase more seats to invite additional members
- You can remove seats if they are not being used

## Managing Your Subscription

- View your current seat count and usage in the Billing tab
- Add or remove seats as your team size changes
- View billing history and upcoming charges in the Billing tab

## Seat Auto-Provisioning

Once your subscription is created, you can toggle **seat auto-provisioning** in the Billing tab. When enabled:

- Automatically adds seats for new @companyName.com members when at capacity
- Ensures new team members can join without manual intervention
- Prevents onboarding delays when all seats are in use

This feature is particularly useful for growing teams where manual seat management might slow down employee onboarding.

## Best Practices for Managing Costs

1. Regularly review your active member count in the Billing tab
2. Remove departed employees promptly to avoid unnecessary charges
3. Use the real-time billing calculator to forecast monthly costs
4. Review billing history to track usage trends
5. Consider enabling seat auto-provisioning for growing teams to streamline onboarding
