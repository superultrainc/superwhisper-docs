## Why Superwhisper Enterprise?

Superwhisper Enterprise is designed to help organizations deploy and manage Superwhisper across their workforce. Here's what you get with an enterprise account:

### Centralized Billing

Manage all your organization's Superwhisper licenses from a single billing dashboard. No more individual subscriptions or expense reports - purchase seats for your team and manage everything in one place.

### Centralized Authentication

Choose the authentication method that works best for your organization:

- **Google OAuth** - Allow members to sign in with their Google Workspace accounts
- **SAML SSO** - Integrate with your existing identity provider (Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, Google, or any SAML 2.0 compatible provider)

This ensures only authorized employees can access your organization's Superwhisper licenses.

### Centralized Model Distribution

Configure which AI models your employees can use. You can:

- Allow access to Superwhisper's cloud models
- Configure custom models with your own API credentials
- Restrict usage to only your organization's approved AI providers

Models are automatically distributed to members every time they start the app.

### In-App Configuration

Deploy consistent settings across your organization. When members activate their license, they receive your organization's configuration automatically - and it stays up to date with every app launch.

### Usage Analytics (Optional)

Optionally collect usage-based statistics to gauge employee adoption and understand how your team is using Superwhisper. This helps you make informed decisions about training and deployment.
