## Adding Members to Your Organization

You have two options for adding employees to your enterprise account:

### Option 1: Join Link

Share a join link that employees can use to join the organization:

1. Navigate to the **Members** tab in your dashboard
2. Click the **Invite** button at the top right of the Members list
3. Generate a join link
4. Share this link with your team members

This option is ideal for:
- Onboarding multiple employees at once
- Sharing in company communication channels
- Self-service account setup

### Option 2: Email Invite

Send direct email invitations to specific users:

1. Navigate to the **Members** tab in your dashboard
2. Click the **Invite** button at the top right of the Members list
3. Enter the email addresses of the team members you want to invite
4. Send the invitations

This option is ideal for:
- Inviting specific individuals
- Controlled onboarding process
- Tracking who has been invited

## Managing Member Roles

You can manage existing members by clicking the three-dot menu next to their name in the members list.

Available actions:
- **Elevate Role** - Grant administrative privileges to a member
- **Change Role** - Modify a member's permissions
- **Revoke Access** - Remove a member from the organization

## What Members Will See

Once a user from your company logs in or accepts an invite, they will see the dashboard with download and activation instructions - exactly as you will see it as an admin in the Overview tab.

If they have been grated an administrative role, they will also see the same admin dash as you, members will only see license and download page. 

### Member Onboarding Flow

Members should follow these steps:

1. **Download the App** - Download the Superwhisper application for their platform
2. **Activate License** - Click the "Activate my License" link from the dashboard

This process will:
- Activate their installation
- Apply your organization's configuration
- Enable automatic config updates every time they start the app

### Configuration Updates

Once activated, every time a member starts the Superwhisper app, it will automatically pull the latest configuration updates for your organization. This ensures:
- Consistent settings across all users
- Automatic deployment of organization policies
- Up-to-date authentication requirements

## Best Practices

### Onboarding New Members

1. Set up billing before inviting members to ensure uninterrupted service
2. Determine which members need administrative access
3. Share onboarding documentation with new users
4. Monitor the Members tab to track activation status

### Security and Access Control

1. Limit administrative access to trusted team members
2. Invite IT/Security personnel for SAML setup rather than sharing credentials
3. Regularly audit member list to ensure only current employees have access
