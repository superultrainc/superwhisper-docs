## Configuring SAML Authentication

### Inviting Technical Team Members

If you need assistance with SAML setup, you can invite IT or Security team members to help with configuration. Until SAML is fully configured, technical members can only access the dashboard via a magic invitation link.

To invite technical team members:

1. Go to the **Members** tab in your dashboard
2. Invite via email as admin (see [Member Management](member_management) for detailed instructions)

This allows your technical team to:
- Access the Authentication page for SAML configuration
- View organization settings and your unique Assertion Consumer Service URL
- Help with technical setup and troubleshooting

### Setting Up SAML

Once on the dashboard, navigate to the Authentication page to find all the information you need to get SAML going, including your organization's unique Assertion Consumer Service URL.

### Authentication Methods

Superwhisper offers two authentication methods:

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Use SAML 2.0 for enterprise SSO integration
2. **Google OAuth** - Allow organization members to sign in with Google accounts

Only one authentication method can be active at a time.

### Setting Up Single Sign-On

Superwhisper supports SAML 2.0 for Single Sign-On. Follow these steps to configure your authentication provider:

#### 1. Select Your Identity Provider

Choose from the supported identity providers:
- **Google** - For Google Workspace organizations
- **Okta** - For Okta identity management
- **Microsoft** - For Azure AD/Microsoft Entra ID
- **Custom** - For other SAML 2.0 compatible providers

#### 2. Configure SP Metadata

Copy the following attributes into your SAML configuration:

**Entity ID:**
```
https://superwhisper.com
```

**Assertion Consumer Service URL:**
```
https://api.superwhisper.com/_external/v1/auth/sso/saml5/callback/{customToYourInstance}
```

> **Note:** Your Assertion Consumer Service URL will be unique to your organization and should be coped from the authentication screen

#### 3. Upload SAML Metadata

Select your identity provider and upload your SAML metadata XML file provided by your authentication provider.

#### 4. Test Your Configuration

Use the "Test" button in the Single Sign-On section to verify your SAML configuration is working correctly. Note depending on identity provider it may take a couple of minutes to have records propogated on their end.
