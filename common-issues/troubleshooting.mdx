## Introduction
Superwhisper is designed to be reliable, but various factors can occasionally affect its performance. This documentation section is designed to help you diagnose and resolve common issues you might encounter.

For your peace of mind, the application automatically saves your dictations every few seconds. You can access your original recordings through [the History tab](../get-started/interface-history) or directly in the [Superwhisper folder](..//get-started/settings-advanced#folder-location).

<Tip>
It is suggested you activate error logging in the Configuration tab. This helps diagnose issues through the application's built-in error tracking system.
