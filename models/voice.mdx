Voice models take your recorded voice and transcribe them into text. There are two types of voice models: local and cloud-based. Local (or Offline) models run on your machine. Cloud models are hosted either by Superwhisper or another provider.

## Superwhisper (Cloud)

These are the models that are hosted in the Cloud by Superwhisper. They are optimized for low latency and accuracy, and are available for use in 100+ languages.

## Whisper Models (Local)

These models run on your machine, allowing you to transcribe audio without relying on external services.
They are based on the [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model series from OpenAI. They run locally using [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp).

## Nvidia Parakeet (Local)

They are based on the [Parakeet](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2) model. They run locally (on your laptop) using Argmax's [WhisperKit SDK](https://github.com/argmaxinc/whisperkit). They are extremely fast and run in parallel over long recordings. Drawbacks here are they do tend to struggle with punctuation and have minor hallucination issues with single word recordings.
